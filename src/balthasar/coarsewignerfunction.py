class CoarseWignerFunction(WignerFunction):
    """ Class to store and plot a coarse-grained discrete Wigner function.

        CoarseWignerFunction inherits many properties from WignerFunction, 
        such as the MUBs, field, dimensions, and the original kernel.

        Args:
            wf (WignerFunction): The Wigner function to coarse-grain.
            coarse_field (GaloisField): A field over which to perform 
                                        coarse-graining. 

        Keyword Args:
            mode (string): There are two modes for coarse-graining, "general",
                           or "subfield". The default mode is "general"; for
                           square dimensions it is also possible to coset using
                           the subfield.
            basis (list of FieldElement): A user-specified basis of the field
                                          in which to perform coarse-graining.
                                          If unspecified, default is the 
                                          polynomial basis. Only valid for the
                                          "general" mode.
            cosets (list of lists): A user-specified partitioning of the 
                                    finite field to use as the cosets for
                                    coarse-graining. Use with caution, as no
                                    perfect checking mechanisms are implemeneted.
            
        Attributes:
            subfield (list): The effective subfield within the large field
            subfield_map (list): Map between elements of the large field with those
                                 in the coarse field
            cosets (list of lists): The set of cosets of the big finite field
            coarse_D (dictionary): Surviving displacement operators, indexed by 
                                   points in the coarse-grained space.
            coarse_kernel (dictionary): The kernel operators for the coarse-
                                        grained Wigner function.
