class Striations():
    """ Striations, sets of parallel lines in the affine plane.

        The rays in discrete phase space are the set of non-intersecting
        lines, save for the point at the origin. Together they cover all of
        phase space. Given a single one of these rays, and translating it 
        by every element in the field, also fully covers the phase space.
        This set of parallel lines is a striation, and is the basis for
        things like Latin squares, as well as the quantum nets defined by
        Wootters when constructing his Wigner functions.
    
        The Striations class is used to construct rays and their translates.
        Mostly it is here just to keep this business separate from the more
        physical aspects of Balthasar.

        Striations are essentially stored as a set of Curves over the provided
        finite field.

        Args: 
            field (GaloisField): The field / discrete phase space to work in.

        Attributes:
            field (GaloisField): The finite field we work in.
            dim (int): The dimension of the space.
            rays (list): The set of curves in this phase space that pass 
                         through the origin. The last ray in the set is the
                         vertical one; the rest can all be accessed by the
                         index which is the power of the primitive element
                         of the slope (e.g. rays of :math:`\\sigma^3` is rays[3]).
            striations (list of lists): A list containing the full set of 
                                        translates for each ray.
