class Curve():
    """ Class to hold all points in a curve. 

        Curves are sets of points of the form :math:`(\\alpha, c(\\alpha)` for
        all :math:`\\alpha` in a specified GaloisField, where

        .. math::
          c(\\alpha) = c_0 + c_1 \\alpha + c_2 \\alpha^2 + ...

        They are constructed by passing in a list of coefficients in the form
        :math:`[c_0, c_1, c_2, \ldots]`.

        Args:
            coefs (list): The coefficients of the curve. 
            field (GaloisField): The field over which the curve is defined.

        Attributes:
            field (GaloisField): The finite field in which is curve is defined
            coefs (list): The coefficients :math:`[c_0, c_1, \ldots]`.
            form (string): "beta" or "alpha", tells whether to do the curve 
                           as :math:`beta = f(alpha) or alpha = f(beta).
                           By default, we use the beta form, beta = f(alpha).
            is_ray (bool): A Boolean which indicates whether the curve passes 
                           through the point (0, 0) or not
            points (list): A list of tuples of field elements which are the 
                           points of this curve over the field.
