            f (GaloisField): The finite field over which the MUBs will be 
                             constructed. Must be expressed in self-dual basis.

        Class MUBs also takes the following keyword arguments.

        Keyword Args:
            curves (list): Advanced functionality. Pass a full set of curves 
                           with which to create the MUB table. By default the
                           set of linear curves is used.
            matrix (bool): Tells Balthasar whether to construct the full
                           numerical matrices for the MUB operators. True
                           by default.

        Class MUBs contains the following public attributes.

        Attributes:
            field (GaloisField): The finite field of choice 
            p (int): A prime number, the dimension of a single particle
            n (int): The number of particles
            dim (int): The dimension of the system dim = :math:`p^n`
            w (pthRootOfUnity): The :math:`p^{th}` root of unity in the field.
            curves (list of Curves): The set of curves used to construct the table
            table: The table of operators, in form (name, phase, matrix)
            D (dictionary): Table of displacement operators, mapping of points
                            in phase space to the associated (phase, matrix)
            matrices (bool): Default true. Constructs the matrices associated
                            with the operators. If set to false, only the 
                            string representations of the operators is computed.

        Currently, class MUBs fully supports only 
        qubit systems (i.e. systems of dimension :math:`2^n`).

    def build_operator_table(self):
        """ Construct the table of MUB operators.

        MUBs are commonly represented in two forms: collections of mutually
        unbiased basis vectors, or a table of disjoint, commuting operators 
        whose sets of mutual eigenvectors are mutually unbiased bases.
        We choose the latter representation, and represent MUBs as a table
        of tuples of the form (name, phase, matrix); the organization of this
        table will be specified after what follows.
        
        An operator in the MUB table is represented as a displacement 
        operator of the form 

        .. math::

         D(\\alpha, \\beta) = \Phi(\\alpha, \\beta) Z_\\alpha X_\\beta

        where :math:`\\alpha, \\beta` are field elements, and 
        :math:`\Phi(\\alpha, \\beta)` is a phase factor.
        The two operators Z and X are defined as having the action
        
        .. math::
 
              Z_\\alpha |\ell \\rangle = \omega(\\alpha \ell) |\ell \\rangle, \quad
              X_\\beta |\ell \\rangle = |\ell + \\beta \\rangle.
              
        For a single qubit these operators are exactly equal to the Pauli
        operators; for multiple qubits, tensor products thereof. Similarly 
        for qudits, they are the generalized Paulis and tensor products thereof.
        These operators satisfy the Heisenberg-Weyl commutation relations, i.e.

        .. math::
              Z_\\alpha X_\\beta = \chi(\\alpha \\beta) X_\\beta Z_\\alpha

        where 

        .. math::
              
             \chi(\\alpha) = \omega ^ {\\text{tr}(\\alpha)}

        is the character of the field, and :math:`\omega` is the pth root of 
        unity, :math:`\exp \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi i}{p} \\right)`.
        
        The trace of a field element is 

        .. math::
 
            \\text{tr}(\\alpha) = \\alpha + \\alpha^p + \cdots + \\alpha^{p^{n - 1}},

        and always yields an element of the mother (base prime) field.

        We can expand :math:`\\alpha` and :math:`\\beta` in terms of a self-
        dual basis :math:`\{\\theta_1, \ldots, \\theta_n\}`:

        .. math::

            \\alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n (a_i \\theta_i), \quad  
            \\beta = \sum_{i=1}^n (b_i \\theta_i),

        where :math:`a_i = \\text{tr}(\\alpha \\theta_i)` and similarly for the 
        :math:`b_i`. With this, we can express the :math:`Z_\\alpha X_\\beta` 
        in tensor product form:

        .. math::

            Z_\\alpha X_\\beta = Z^{a_1} X^{b_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes Z^{a_n} X^{b_n}


        In a way, we can consider this as assigning each self-dual basis 
        element to a single particle.

        Displacement operators will be stored in a dictionary of tuples,
        indexed by the coordinates in phase space :math:`(\\alpha, \\beta)`.
        The values have the form

         (name, :math:`\Phi(\\alpha, \\beta)`, :math:`Z_\\alpha X_\\beta`)
       
        Here name will be something like "Z ZX X", or a string representing
        the tensor product structure above. The phase factor is included 
        separately from the matrix because they're not always needed.

        
        By default, we will produce MUBs of the Desarguesian form, 
        where :math:`\\beta = \lambda \\alpha`.
